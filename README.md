# Description
***

This is my "infrastructure as code" Chef repository used to setup my personal media server. It uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization of the applications and [ZFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS) for the data storage layer.  In addition, it uses various Python, C++, and .NET applications to fetch, process, organize, and deliver media. All of the applications communicate via RESTful API's.

There is a [companion repository](https://github.com/skingry/dockerfiles) that contains all of the `Dockerfiles` needed to build the containers.
